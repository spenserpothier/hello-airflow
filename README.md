# Hello Airflow

## Getting started

Using docker compose file from documentation [quickstart](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/docker.html#docker-compose-yaml)

_NOTE:_ When using Docker with WSL, some permissions errors can happen if started using windows based docker tools vs WSL/ubuntu based docker tools. TL;DR - Permissions can get wacky, stick with docker compose in WSL.
